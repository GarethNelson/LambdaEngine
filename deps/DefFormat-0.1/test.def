# This is a simple test def file

# blank lines should be totally ignored


# here is our first section, in this example an imaginary server configuration which listens to port 8080 on localhost
SERVER
LISTENIP: 127.0.0.1
LISTENPORT: 8080
%%

# as you can see, the section is terminated by %%, blank lines are NOT required however, and are added here only
# for the sake of visual clarity

# here we have multiple USER sections, the first of which has an extra field (REALNAME) - each record can have
# any arbitary records, there is no schema enforcement
USER
USERNAME: gareth
REALNAME: Gareth Nelson
PASSWORD: 1234
%%
USER
USERNAME: bob
PASSWORD: supersecret
%%

# after this last record, we close the file, note that the trailing newline is optional

USER
USERNAME: fred
PASSWORD: anotherone
