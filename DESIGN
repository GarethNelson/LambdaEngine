Each map has 4 parts:
1 - Visual: made up of tiles, each being a textured quad in OpenGL
2 - Collision map: a black and white bitmap
3 - Hotzones: hotzones for scripting defined via coloured patches in a bitmap, entities are single pixels
4 - Map definition: text file describing map name and assigning IDs for hotzones and spawning entities

The hotzones in the map definition are defined using RGB colours

Map compiler:
 Takes a large visual and cuts it into tiles
 Removes all but one colour from collision map and turns it black and white (makes it easier to draw collisions by editing the visual and then converting)
 Spits out C file with data about hotzones and other misc info based on map definition
 Generates seperate collision map, visual tileset, entities map and hotzones map (see below)

Map definition file:
 Provides human-readable map name and C identifier
 Provides C identifier for each hotzone
 Provides entity type and C identifier for each entity

Every map must have at least one entity: the player entity

Entities are given C identifiers and classes
 Entity classes need not be predefined, simply use the class and the compiler will spit out hooks in the C code
 Entity animations are loaded from the relevant spriteset

Game logic:
 Seperate dynamic lib made up of the C files from map compiler and any scripting logic via event hooks etc

Game logic compiler:
 Takes a game/mod definition file
 Compiles maps and links the resulting C code into a dynamic lib
 Builds hooks for entity classes defined in maps
 Compiles + links any extra C code

Compilers are both invocable in 2 modes:
 1 - Preprocess - spits out source code and bitmaps for editing, does not compile C code or link dynamic lib
 2 - Build - run the complete process

console:
 stdio only at first (later upgrade to using quake-style console)

VFS layer:
 PAK files loaded from disk in a set order: core first, then mods
 mod PAKs override earlier PAKs
   e.g if a mod is loaded after core, files with the same name in the mod override core
       mods also override other mods in the same name

Core PAKs:
 There are 2 core PAKs:
   core01.pak contains the renderer, sound system and input system
   core02.pak contains the game
 Patches for particular subsystems can (and should) be released as PAKs, for example:
   patch01.pak

core01 libs:
 lambda_video.so
  Contains code for initialising display and getting an OpenGL context
  Also handles things like double buffering
 lambda_map.so
  Contains code for loading+rendering maps using OpenGL
 lambda_input.so
  Contains code for getting input and triggering the relevant events

At startup, core01.pak and core02.pak are loaded followed by any patches

pak file structure:
 Standard zip file
 gameinfo.def               Copy of the game definition file
 modinfo.def                Copy of the mod definition file (only used in mod paks)
 libs/                      Any dynamic libs in this path are loaded at runtime, allowing for mods etc
     game.so                Game logic and compiled map definitions - must be present somewhere, probably core02.pak
     md5sums.core01         In core01.pak, this contains MD5 checksums used by the cache system
