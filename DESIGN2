Inputs:
 Map visual                  - needs to be cut into tiles
 Non-greyscale collision map - needs to be turned into black+white bitmap
 Hotzones map                - needs to be turned into list of hotzone C identifiers + hotzones-only map
 Entities map                - needs to be turned into list of entity coordinates with entity classes

Tools:
lambdacutvis
 cuts visual into tile bitmaps and a .def file specifying the tiles
 possible later optimisation: automatically determine repeated tiles and store the tilemap in .def file
